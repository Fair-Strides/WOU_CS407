<p>This is my portfolio for CS407 - Seminar of Computer Graphics with JavaScript. I will expand on it as I continue to develop my skills throughout my assignments.</p>
<br />
<p>My name is Tristan Goucher, and I'm a senior at Western Oregon University. This class is developing a site using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML using SveltKit as a front-end framework. For deploying to the internet, we make use of Vercel.</p>

<p>While you're currently viewing the production version of what I've accomplished, the code behind all of this can be found in the footer from any page.</p>
